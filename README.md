### App Evaluation

- **Mobile:** This app is primarily developed as a mobile application but would be viable as a desktop application or an android application. Functionality and features are not just limited to mobile devices.
- **Story:** Stores a users e-books through a pdf, and provides optionality to upload new pdfs. User can then open an e-book and allow user to scroll through book and exit reading through use of eyes.
- **Market:**  Any individual could choose to use and read through this app. Usable for users of all age demographics.
- **Habit:** This app could be used as often or often as user wants depending on a users physical ability or limitations.
- **Scope:** First we would start with selecting a book then we would then calibrate our eye tracking application to prepare for reading. A new windows then would be opened with the e-book to read which can now be controlled with the user’s eyes to scroll and also exit the book.
